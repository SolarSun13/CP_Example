### How To Contribute
New to **GitHub**? Feel free to learn the basics getting started [here](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github)!

The contribution process is simple, checkout the steps below:

* **Step 1** Check the [Issues](https://github.com/kpal81xd/krunkdocs/issues) tab at the top left of the repository to see if there is anything you are able to help out with or if there is already an on-going discussion related to your contribution inquiry. If you see something, feel free to check-in there to see if you would be able to help as a contributer to the issue.

* **Step 2** If you do not see your topic highlighted anywhere, feel free to [Create an Issue](https://github.com/kpal81xd/krunkdocs/issues/new) yourself and await confirmation before beginning work on your contribution. Once your **Issue** has been approved and you have been given the go-ahead with your contribution, you may proceed with your work.

* **Step 3** Once you are finished and ready to present your contribution, submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/kpal81xd/krunkdocs/pulls) for review. You may [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the repository and submit a request [from there](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork), or submit a stand alone pull request. Be sure your fork is up to date by [Syncing](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) and fetching upstream.

* **Step 4** You may also submit your contribution directly through a [Pull Request](https://github.com/kpal81xd/krunkdocs/pulls) without first having opened an Issue beforehand. Keep in mind, this does not gaurantee payout approval. (see [payments](./README.md#payments))

* **Step 5** Upon approval, 

###### Alternatively, you may DM `User#0000` on Discord with your completed contributions, or if you have any further questions.

### Payments (WIP)

> ###### However, these cases may be fine most of the time as long as there is no further conflict with existing issues or pending pull requests. Scenarios where if there were conflict will be handled on a case by case basis and may result with a combined contribution.

#### Note
> ######  (temp placement) Contributions over time will not stack towards a higher tiered payout, as payouts are fulfilled per each accepted contribution. Contributions over time however will be noted with the consideration of rewarding the Doc Editor in-game badge. Any abuse of this payout system will not be tolerated. Similar requests may be combined.

---

### Doc Reviewers (WIP)
> *15% of contribution payout
